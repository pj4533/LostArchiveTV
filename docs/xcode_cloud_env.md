1. Where Environment Variables Live in Xcode Cloud

In Xcode Cloud, environment variables are handled through:
	‚Ä¢	Environment Variables (specific to a workflow)
	‚Ä¢	Secrets (for sensitive values like API keys, tokens, etc.)

You set them up per workflow in App Store Connect.

‚∏ª

2. How to Set Them Up
	‚Ä¢	Go to App Store Connect ‚Üí My Apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Xcode Cloud ‚Üí Workflows.
	‚Ä¢	Pick your workflow (or create a new one).
	‚Ä¢	Scroll down to Environment Variables section.
	‚Ä¢	Click Add Environment Variable.

You can define:
	‚Ä¢	Name: Like MY_API_URL or API_KEY.
	‚Ä¢	Value: The actual value.
	‚Ä¢	Scope: You can limit to Build, Test, or Archive phases, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Security:
	‚Ä¢	Regular environment variables are visible in logs.
	‚Ä¢	Secrets are hidden in logs (good for sensitive stuff).

3. How to Access Them in Your Code

If you want to access the environment variable in Swift code:

You need to expose it at build time. Usually this is done via:
	‚Ä¢	Info.plist injection (best for app config)
	‚Ä¢	or Swift build settings (like setting a custom compiler flag)

Here‚Äôs an easy way:

(A) Modify your .xcconfig file (or add one if you don‚Äôt have one):

MY_API_URL = $(MY_API_URL)

Then in Xcode Build Settings for your target:
	‚Ä¢	Add a User-Defined Setting: MY_API_URL = $(MY_API_URL)

(B) Then, in Swift, use:

let apiURL = Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: "MY_API_URL") as? String

But you have to inject it into Info.plist:

<key>MY_API_URL</key>
<string>$(MY_API_URL)</string>

Alternative:
You can also access pure environment variables at runtime with:

let apiKey = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["API_KEY"]

(but that is only available at runtime on the cloud machine, not in the built app normally.)

4. Tips
	‚Ä¢	If you need different environment variables for different workflows (like Dev vs Production), set them separately in each workflow.
	‚Ä¢	Use Secrets if it‚Äôs anything private ‚Äî Xcode Cloud automatically redacts them from logs.

‚∏ª

Example:

Say you add:
	‚Ä¢	Name: MY_API_URL
	‚Ä¢	Value: https://api.example.com
	‚Ä¢	Secret: No

In your Info.plist:

<key>MY_API_URL</key>
<string>$(MY_API_URL)</string>

Now when you build, MY_API_URL will be populated from Xcode Cloud‚Äôs environment at build time.

Would you like me to also show you how to conditionally switch configs based on the workflow, like automatically detecting if it‚Äôs a ‚Äústaging‚Äù or ‚Äúproduction‚Äù build? üöÄ (It‚Äôs a really slick trick.)
